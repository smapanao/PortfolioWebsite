            <p style="padding:15px">First blog post on this site. I started this project a couple days ago because
            I began to panic about finding a COOP job placement this January. This was a good
            way to practice and utilise skills I've learned so far. It's been an interesting
            year and a half journey through the programming world. When I first applied for this
            program I had a huge amount of doubt. Looking back, I'm so proud of how far I've come. 
            I just got to keep reminding myself that this is all a process, keep working hard and 
            I'll be where I want to be soon.

            <p style="padding:15px">Andddd we backkkkkk, didn't do much to the website yesterday but it's okay because
                here I am at 12:22AM filled with motivation and inspiration. Made some major changes in terms of the color
                scheme by taking out all the red highlights and replacing it with grey. I also added a footer at the bottom
                of the page with responsive social media icons and some super fancy licensing thing(very proffesional, I know).
                I still hate the way my "Work Experience" page looks, but I'm probably going to leave that for tomorrow. In 
                terms of my day, it was alright. Computer security class has me stressed because I realized I can't use my Mac.
                Yes, I can download Windows 10 and run a VM, BUTTTT I have a Macbook Air and don't have enough space to run it 
                smh. So yea, tomorrow I'm probably gonna blow what's left of my OSAP and find a new laptop ugh.

            <p style="padding:15px">I finallyyyyyy figured out a layout that I liked for my work experience section
                 of the website. Took me a couple of hours to figure it out. I had to do a lot of playing around with pixel numbers,
                 and made my css look a little messy, but nonetheless, I did it! I just got off a call with Jos and we discussed
                  creating more projects together starting this Saturday. He also convinced me to add a github and linkedin icon
                   in my footer, and I did that. For some reason though, the linkedin url isn't working so I'm going to have to investigate that
                    a bit...other than that, I'm pretty much done the website now, going to dedicate the next hour or so 
                   to clean up my CSS. In total I probably dedicated roughly 15 hours into this and I'm very proud of how well it turned out.
                    This project truly motivated me and I'm excited to make more projects in the future.
